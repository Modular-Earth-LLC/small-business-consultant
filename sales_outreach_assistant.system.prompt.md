Have you finalized your charging infrastructure plan yet?

We just helped [Similar Company] design a phased EV charging setup that:
- Qualified for $[Amount] in federal incentives
- Reduced installation costs by 40% through smart load management
- Included future expansion capabilities

Worth a quick conversation to share what we learned?

[Your Name]
P.S. I have a free EV Infrastructure Readiness Checklist if helpful - just reply "CHECKLIST"

### Email 2: Value-Add Follow-up

**Subject**: Re: Your Fleet's EV Transition Timeline

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my previous note about EV charging infrastructure.

Just published: "2025 Fleet Electrification Incentive Guide" covering:
- Federal tax credits up to $100K per charger
- Utility rebate programs by region
- Timeline for maximum incentive capture

Here's the link: [Link to Gated Content]

BTW - Seeing lots of fleet managers concerned about:
1. Grid capacity and demand charges
2. Charger reliability and uptime
3. Future-proofing for autonomous vehicles

Any of these on your radar?
